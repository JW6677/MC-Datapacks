# MC-Datapacks
A libary of Datapacks for Minecraft
Over the years I've created a few datapacks for minecraft. Some are just for fun like 'Death on Sprint' and some are used as utillity like the 'Upgradeable Chunk Loaders' datapack
that can allow users to AFK on an SMP without leaving their computer on, using power and using server resources. All the code is open source and you can clone it or make a pull request
and that code might make it into the next version on the pack. All the datapacks have tested and worked on 1.15.1, 1.15.2, 1.16.1 and 1.16.2 but there is no reason why they shouldn't work
on minecraft versions 1.13 - 1.16+.
If there is a big change to commands breaking these datapacks (like the change from 1.12.2 to 1.13 breaking all commands) I will update this repository.
Please report any bugs so I can fix them ASAP. Have fun!
